# Array-Oscilators
A very basic boilerplate for organising oscilators into an array as a basis of audio synthesis and using the index to modulate the filter frequency and the positive or negative detuning.

The first index of the array is separated because this allows for some differentiation in methodology. As very basic boilerplate i haven't made the start button as a function that rebuilds the web audio to analyser chain. 

## Visualisation

Very basic canvas visualisation has been included along with a start and stop button. The stopping a oscilator node is perminant so this is just to keep things clean for testing. 


## Ideas

Moving forward with index based modulation, and adding then splitting out more components would be a very simple extention.

Propper exponential frequency shifts.

Widening the noise with panning, splitting the even and odd indexes into frequency pairs left and right would be an easy way to widen the noise. (i have a position based fairly extensive panning project I am now workig backwards and refactoring)

panning between with an lfo.

Building a multi-bandpass filter eq, compressing etc.

addative or subtractive synthesis exploration.

waveshaping, isolating frequency bands.

building my own comb filter

(currently formants seem pretty well covered with people's web audio projects)

more to come
